**COVID-19 Vaccination Data Analysis in India using Python**

In this project, I performed "Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)" & "Visualization" on real-world COVID-19 vaccination data to uncover meaningful insights:
✅ State-wise vaccination distribution 
✅ Monthly and weekly vaccination trends 
✅ Vaccination distribution by gender and age group 
✅ Vaccine type analysis (Covishield, Covaxin, Sputnik V) 
✅ Cleaned, transformed and visualized data

🔍 My project answers through visualizations:
- Which states vaccinated the most?
- How did monthly trends evolve?
- Who got vaccinated more: Males or Females?
- Which vaccine was most widely used?

📌 Key Observations:
- Maharashtra & Uttar Pradesh led in total vaccinations 
- 45–60 age group received the highest doses 
- Males had a slight lead in total vaccinated count 
- Covishield was the most administered vaccine

🛠️ **Tools Used:**
- Python (Jupyter Notebook)
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
