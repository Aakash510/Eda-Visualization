### Let's understand my projects insights using the STAR method


#### 1. Situation: 

My project involved an **'Exploratory Data Analysis'** on a large public health dataset of over 230,000 records, focusing on **various health and demographic indicators.**


#### 2. Task 
Goal is **'Create a short research report'** on Healthcare Analytics 
to uncover the **graded risk** and **compound relationships** between variables like BMI, Age, and chronic conditions, and the actual occurrence of heart disease."


#### 3 . Actions 
For this i first conduct **univariant analysis** and in this focus on only one feature at a time, 
look at plotting like histogram, bar plot and pie plot to understand the distribution, central tendency any outliers and dispersion of that variables.

Then move on to **bivariant analysis** and in this,  i understand is there any one variable impact the value of another variables.
and perform some **statistical technique** like **co-relation matric,  pivot tables** and plot like scatter plot and line to establish the empirical relationship between two variables.


#### 4. Result: Discuss the outcomes of your actions.

After plotting line plot and scatter plot we find that 
- The Individual's  **smoking level increases** and have **not done any physical activity** have their HeartDisease or Attack  tends to **slightly increases,** 
but the relationship is not strong positive.

From bar plot we find that
- Most heart disease cases are occurred in the **older age groups (around 55–75 years).**
also people with **lower education levels** or as the **illiteracy rate is increase** have a **higher chance** of heart disease or attack.
